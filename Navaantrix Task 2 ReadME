# Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is used to understand and visualize the data and builds a predictive model on a sales dataset.

# 1. Data Loading and Exploration:
#    - Displaying the first and last few rows using `head()` and `tail()`.
#    - Generating descriptive statistics using `describe()`.

# 2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
#    - Handles missing values. It removes a nulls in a column  and fills missing values using appropriate strategies (e.g., filling with the mode or a constant).

# 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
#    - Summary Statistics: Calculates and prints summary statistics for numerical features, including mean, standard deviation, min, max, etc.
#    - Correlation Analysis: Calculates and visualizes the correlation between numerical features in the dataset. This helps identify relationships between variables.
#    - Sales by State:Groups sales data by state and visualizes total sales per state using a bar chart.
#    - Order Quantity Distribution: Visualizes the distribution of order quantities using a histogram.
#    - Scatter Plot (Sales vs. Quantity Ordered):Creates a scatter plot of sales against the quantity ordered, colored by product line. This helps visualize the relationship between these two variables.

# 4. Predictive Modeling (Linear Regression):
#    - Model Training: Trains a linear regression model to predict sales based on the quantity ordered. The dataset is split into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`.
#    - Model Evaluation: Evaluates the model's performance using the R-squared metric, which indicates the goodness of fit of the model.
#    - Visualization: Visualizes the model's predictions against the actual sales values in a scatter plot. The red line represents the linear regression model's prediction, and the blue points represent actual sales data.

# 5. Interactive Dashboard (Plotly):
#    - Sales by State (Bar Chart): Creates an interactive bar chart to show sales per state, allowing users to explore the data more interactively.
#    - Sales Distribution (Histogram): An interactive histogram showing the distribution of sales.
#    - Sales vs. Quantity Ordered (Scatter Plot): Similar to the static scatter plot, but interactive.
#    - Sales by Product Line (Pie Chart): A pie chart displaying the distribution of sales across different product lines.
#    - Sales Trend Over Time (Line Chart): If there is a 'ORDERDATE' column, the code creates an interactive line chart to visualize sales trends over time, aggregated by month.


# - **Strengths:**
#     - Comprehensive EDA: Covers various aspects of the data through descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and visualizations.
#     - Predictive Modeling:  Applies a linear regression model to predict sales.
#     - Interactive Visualizations:  Uses Plotly to create interactive dashboards, allowing exploration of the data.

# - **Weaknesses/Potential Improvements:**
#     - Simple Predictive Model: Linear regression is a basic model. More complex models (e.g., decision trees, random forests, or neural networks) might provide better predictions if the data exhibits more complex relationships.
#     - Feature Engineering: Limited feature engineering.  Creating new features from existing ones (e.g., combining 'ORDERDATE' with other features) could improve predictive accuracy.
#     - Model Validation: Only R-squared is used to evaluate the model. Other metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) should be considered.
#     - More In-depth Analysis: Exploring categorical features in more detail (e.g., 'PRODUCTLINE', 'TERRITORY') through more informative visualizations and statistical tests could provide additional insights.
